# No Design Guidelines Required

## Project Classification: Backend API Only

This project is a **pure backend API system** with no frontend interface component. The specifications clearly define:

- REST API endpoint (`/api/process`) receiving POST requests from SpeakSpace
- Rule-based text processing engine
- Automated email report generation
- JSON response formatting
- Incident logging system

**No user-facing interface exists in the current scope.**

## If Frontend Is Needed (Not Currently Specified)

If you'd like to add a visual interface to this system, please specify which of these components you need:

### Potential Frontend Options:
1. **Admin Dashboard** - View incident logs, statistics, and reports
2. **Testing Interface** - Manual input form to test the harassment detection engine
3. **Monitoring Panel** - Real-time status of API health and incident processing
4. **Report Viewer** - Browse and search historical incident reports

Please clarify if you need any of these interfaces, and I'll provide comprehensive design guidelines accordingly.

**Current Status:** Backend implementation only - proceed with API development without visual design requirements.
